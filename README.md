# Tiny-OS

Welcome to my mini Operating System project! The goal of my project is just for me to explore the fundamental workings of computers, including how hardware interacts with machine code and how assembly serves as a bridge between machine code and high-level programming languages.

## tools i use
- NANO text editor
- NASM (assembler)
- QEMU (virtual machine)
